class TFBaseModelOutputWithPast(ModelOutput):
    """
    Base class for model's outputs that may also contain a past key/values (to speed up sequential decoding).

    Args:
        last_hidden_state (:obj:`tf.Tensor` of shape :obj:`(batch_size, sequence_length, hidden_size)`):
            Sequence of hidden-states at the output of the last layer of the model.

            If :obj:`past_key_values` is used only the last hidden-state of the sequences of shape :obj:`(batch_size,
            1, hidden_size)` is output.
        past_key_values (:obj:`List[tf.Tensor]`, `optional`, returned when ``use_cache=True`` is passed or when ``config.use_cache=True``):
            List of :obj:`tf.Tensor` of length :obj:`config.n_layers`, with each tensor of shape :obj:`(2, batch_size,
            num_heads, sequence_length, embed_size_per_head)`).

            Contains pre-computed hidden-states (key and values in the attention blocks) that can be used (see
            :obj:`past_key_values` input) to speed up sequential decoding.
        hidden_states (:obj:`tuple(tf.Tensor)`, `optional`, returned when ``output_hidden_states=True`` is passed or when ``config.output_hidden_states=True``):
            Tuple of :obj:`tf.Tensor` (one for the output of the embeddings + one for the output of each layer) of
            shape :obj:`(batch_size, sequence_length, hidden_size)`.

            Hidden-states of the model at the output of each layer plus the initial embedding outputs.
        attentions (:obj:`tuple(tf.Tensor)`, `optional`, returned when ``output_attentions=True`` is passed or when ``config.output_attentions=True``):
            Tuple of :obj:`tf.Tensor` (one for each layer) of shape :obj:`(batch_size, num_heads, sequence_length,
            sequence_length)`.

            Attentions weights after the attention softmax, used to compute the weighted average in the self-attention
            heads.
